       "Original question": "Does the following congruence x^2 \u2261 \u22122 (mod 118) have solutions, if so how many?",
       "Solution": "We have 118 = 2 \u00b7 59. Now the congruence x^2 \u2261 \u22122 \u2261 0 (mod 2) has a unique solution, and x^2 \u2261 \u22122 (mod 59) has two solutions because \u22122/59 = \u22121/59 * 2/59 = (-1)*(-1) = 1. Therefore there are two solutions to the original congruence."
