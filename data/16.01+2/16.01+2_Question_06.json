       "Original question": "Consider the system of equations\nx+ y\u22122z=\u22121 x + 4y + 2z = 5 x+y\u2212z=0\nFall 2003\nSolve for x, y, and z, in three separate ways. The goal of part (1) is to practice solving systems of equations, so that when you get to part (2), you will have a fair basis of comparison.\n(a) Determine x, y, and z using (symbolic) elimination of variables. (b) Determine x, y, and z by Gaussian reduction.\n(c) Determine x, y, and z using Cramer\u2019s rule.",
       "Solution": "x + y \u2212 2z = \u22121 x + 4 y + 2z = 5 x+y\u2212z=0\nx + y \u2212 2 z = \u22121 x + 4y + 2z = 5 2 x + 5 y = 4\n\u22122(3x + 6 y = 5) 3(2x + 5y = 4) 3y = 2\n3x + 6(2 / 3) = 5 3x = 1\n1/ 2 + 2 / 3 \u2212 z = 0\n1.b\nx + 4 y + 2 z = 5 2(x + y \u2212 z) = 0 3x + 6 y = 5\n    y=2/3\nx =1/3\n z=1"
