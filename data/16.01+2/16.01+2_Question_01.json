       "Original question": "a) Assuming steady-level flight and no fuel reserves, estimate the range of a B-777 using the information given in the lecture notes (and/or on Boeing\u2019s web page). How well does this compare to the estimates Boeing publishes on their web page?\nb) Now assuming that L/D, propulsion system efficiency and final weight are unchanged, estimate the range of a B-777 if the same volume of liquid hydrogen were to be used instead of Jet-A.",
       "Solution": "You get about 18000km using the ratio of the operating empty mass and the max takeoff mass (1.9). The estimate of 18000km is more than 30% too high, but I did neglect the weight of the passengers and their cargo, food (such as it is), and reserve fuel. When these items are taken into account the estimate is within 10% of the published values.     To do this I wrote Wfinal=Winitial-Wfuel = Winitial-\u03c1fuel Vfuel. The ratio of the two densities is 0.0875. So the initial weight is only 156,000 kg (144,000kg + 0.0875x137,000kg), and the weight ratio drops to 1.08. Of course the heating value is increased by a factor of 2.8, but it hardly makes up for the reduction in the amount of energy that is carried due to hydrogen\u2019s low density. My estimate for the range is 6100km, a reduction by a factor of three from the case with Jet-A.\n"
