       "Course": "Unified Engineering 1 and 2",
       "Topic": "Materials and Structures",
       "Original question": "Define a thermoplastic and a thermoset.",
       "Solution": "A thermoplastic softens dramatically with increasing temperature. A thermoset does not. Thermoplastics consist of long polymer chains with no covalent cross-links between the chains. The chains are bonded together by Van der Waals bonds. Thermosets have covalent crosslinks between the chains."
