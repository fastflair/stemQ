       "Original question": "The weight of an object is measured using an electronic scale that reports the true weight plus a random fluctuation that is normally distributed with zero mean. The manufacturing company of the electronic scale claims that the standard deviation of the fluctuation is 2 milligrams. Assume that the fluctuations are independent. The company measures the weight of one object 8 times, and observes these values: 100.9, 98.2, 101.5, 102.2, 105.1, 99.4, 93.6, 97.5. You believe that the standard deviation of the fluctuation is greater than what the company claims. Is there statistically significant evidence for your belief at \u03b1 = 5% level?",
       "Solution": "\u03c72 = 21.1, The P-value is P(\u03c72_7 > 21.1) = 0.0036 and therefore there is statistically significant evidence for\nour belief at \u03b1 = 5% level."
