       "Original question": "The returns of an asset management firm in different years are independent and normally distributed\nwith unknown mean and variance. The asset management firm claims that the standard deviation of\nthe returns is as low as \u03c3 = 2% and the mean of the returns is \u00b5 = 22%. You believe that this is too\ngood to be true. To verify your suspicion, you take the returns from the last 10 years. These are:\nr = {20.6, 19.2, 17, 19.1, 18.7, 22.5, 27.2, 17.9, 22.5, 21.3}. Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation of the above random sample.",
       "Solution": "20.6, 2.97"
