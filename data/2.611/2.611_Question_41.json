       "Original question": "8. The rotor of a certain 25 hp, 6 pole, 60Hz induction motor has an equivalent\nresistance and reactance per phase is 0.1 \u2126 and 0.5 \u2126 respectively. The blocked\nrotor voltage/phase is 150 V. If the rotor is turning at 1164 rpm, determine:\na. synchronous speed\nb. slip\nc. rotor impedance\nd. rotor current\ne. rotor current is changing the shaft load resulted in 1.25% slip\nf. speed for condition in e.",
