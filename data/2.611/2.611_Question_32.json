       "Original question": "The air standard dual-cycle is used to represent the thermodynamic characteristics of a large two-stroke diesel engine. The cylinder volume V1=1.0 m^3; the compression ratio r_v = 13; the value of r_p = 1.8; and the cut-off ratio r_c = 1.4 the temperature of the air entering the cylinder T_1 = 300 K; and the pressure p_1 = 1.0 bar\nDetermine: d. the work of the engine per cycle in kJ, and the power per cylinder\nin kW, when the two-stroke engine operates at 79 rpm",
       "Solution": NaN
