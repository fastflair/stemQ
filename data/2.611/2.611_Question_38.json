Calculate the required cross sectional area for the inlet duct if the inlet\nduct velocity is 25 m/s for the turbine. Assume that the ambient air\noutside the ship is at 1 bar and 298K\nAssume that the working fluids are air (\u03b3a = 1.4 and cpa = 1.005 kJ/kg K) for the\ncompressor and the combustion products (\u03b3p = 1.33 and cpp = 1.130 kJ/kg K) for\nthe turbine. The fuel for the combustor is at 25\u00b0 C and the heating value (LHV) is\n43,000 kJ/kg.",
