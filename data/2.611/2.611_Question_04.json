       "Original question": "A survey vessel has a 10 ft diameter, B 5-90 propeller with a pitch of 10 ft. The propeller speed is 200 rpm,\nthe boat speed is 20 knots, and the thrust reduction factor (t) is 0.12, wake fraction (w) is 0.18, and the relative\nrotational efficiency \u03b7R is 1.0. The propeller operates as indicated by the Wageningen (Troost) Series B propeller charts. Determine\nd. The propeller shaft power (delivered power) PD",
       "Solution": "1.937 * 10^3 hp"
