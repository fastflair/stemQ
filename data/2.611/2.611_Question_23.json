       "Original question": "5. A marine steam plant operates as a simple Rankine cycle with a turbine inlet\ntemperature and pressure of 600 \u00b0C and 4 MPa. The condenser operates at a pressure of\n20kPa. Assume that the turbine isentropic efficiency is 80% and the pump isentropic\nefficiency is 90%.\n c. Determine the specific enthalpy change across each component.",
