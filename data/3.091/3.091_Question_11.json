       "Original question": "Solid oxide fuel cells rely on the reaction of fuel with oxygen to form water. A ceramic oxide can be doped to introduce oxygen vacancies that allow charge to conduct through the solid electrolyte. Zirconia (ZrO2) can be doped by adding Sc2O3. If 0.5g of Sc2O3 can be incorporated into 10g of ZrO2 while maintaining the zirconia structure, how many oxygen vacancies are generated?\n",
       "Solution": "2.18 * 10^21"
