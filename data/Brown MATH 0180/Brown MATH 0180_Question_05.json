       "Original question": "A bird is attempting to fly northeast at a constant speed, but a wind blowing southward at 5 miles per hour blows the bird off course. If the bird\u2019s overall movement (incorporating its intended movement and the movement due to wind) is at a speed of \u221a53 miles per hour, how fast would it have been traveling if there was no wind?",
       "Solution": "7\u221a2 miles per hour"
