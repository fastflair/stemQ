       "Original question": "Consider the formation of MgO (s). Assume that \u0394H r\u00b0 and \u0394Sr\u00b0 are independent of temperature. Mg (s) + 1/2 O2 (g) \u2192 MgO (s). \u0394H r\u00b0 = -602 kJ/mol. \u0394Sr\u00b0 = -108 JK-1mol-1. Calculate \u0394G r\u00b0 for the formation of MgO (s) at 0 \u00b0C (273 K). Is the reaction spontaneous\nor non-spontaneous at 0 \u00b0C?",
       "Solution": "- 573 kJ/mol, spontaneous"
