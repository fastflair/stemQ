       "Original question": "A beam of light with an intensity of 15 W is incident on a copper plate (\u03c6 = 7.43 x 10-19 J). Electrons with a minimum wavelength of 3.75 x 10-10 m are ejected from the surface of the copper. Calculate the maximum number of electrons that can be ejected by a 3.0-second pulse of\nthe incident light. \n",
       "Solution": "1.8 * 10^19 electrons"
