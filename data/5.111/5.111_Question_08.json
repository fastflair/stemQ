       "Original question": "An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiment with an unidentified element, X, displays an emission spectrum with four distinct kinetic energies: 5.9 x 10^-17 J, 2.53 x 10^-18 J, 2.59 x 10^- 20 J, and 2.67 x 10^-20 J. (Assume the incident light has sufficient energy to eject any electron in the atom.) Consider both the filled and unfilled orbitals of element X. Determine the number of degenerate 5p orbitals.",
       "Solution": "3"
