       "Original question": "A beam of light with an intensity of 15 W is incident on a copper plate (\u03c6 = 7.43 x 10-19 J). Electrons with a minimum wavelength of 3.75 x 10-10 m are ejected from the surface of the copper. If a new light source (Ei = 7.19 x 10-19 J) with an intensity of 35 W is incident on the copper surface, what is the maximum number of electrons that can be ejected from a 6.0 second pulse of light?",
       "Solution": "0"
