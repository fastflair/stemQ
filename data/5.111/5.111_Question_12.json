       "Original question": "KF has an ionic bond with a bond length of 0.217 nm. Calculate the \u2206E, in kJ/mol, for the formation of a KF bond from the neutral atoms K and F. For this calculation, assume that the potassium and fluorine ions are point charges. IE and EA information for K and F is provided in the table below. (IE of K= 418 kJ/mol, IE of F= 1680 kJ/mol, EA of K= 48 kJ/mol, EA of F= 328 kJ/mol)",
       "Solution": "-550. kJ/mol"
