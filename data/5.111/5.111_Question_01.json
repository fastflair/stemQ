       "Original question": "A beam of light with an intensity of 15 W is incident on a copper plate (\u03c6 = 7.43 x 10-19 J). Electrons with a minimum wavelength of 3.75 x 10-10 m are ejected from the surface of the copper. Calculate the frequency of the incident light.",
       "Solution": "7.43 * 10^-19 J"
