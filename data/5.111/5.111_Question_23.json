       "Original question": "For a cell constructed with a Cu (s) | Cu2+ (aq) anode and Ag+\n (aq) | Ag (s) cathode at 25.0\u00b0C. Calculate the cell potential at 25.0\u00b0C under non-standard conditions:\n[Cu2+] = 0.300 M and [ Ag+] = 0.0500 M. (E\u00b0 for Cu2+ (aq) + 2e-\r\n \u21d2 Cu(s) is 0.34 volts and E\u00b0 for Ag+ (aq) + 1e- \u2192 Ag (s) is 0.80 volts)",
       "Solution": "0.40 V"
