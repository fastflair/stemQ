       "Original question": "An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiment with an unidentified element, X, displays an emission spectrum with four distinct kinetic energies: 5.9 x 10^-17 J, 2.53 x 10^-18 J, 2.59 x 10^- 20 J, and 2.67 x 10^-20 J. (Assume the incident light has sufficient energy to eject any electron in the atom.) Calculate the binding energy of an electron in the 2p orbital of element X if the x-rays used for the spectroscopy experiment had an energy of 2.68 x 10^-16 J.",
       "Solution": " -2.65 * 10^-16 J"
