       "Original question": "What values would d, D, and w take if J\u00a8onsson\u2019s apparatus were simply scaled up for use with visible light rather than electrons?",
       "Solution": "a =\u03bb*/ \u03bb = 550 = 100182. 5.49 \u00d7 10\u22123;  The suitable values for d, D,w are then d* = ad = 20 cm, D* = aD = 35064 m, w* = aw = 9.6 cm "
