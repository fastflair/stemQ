       "Original question": "What is the major source of chlorine in seawater? How about sodium? How about sulfate?",
       "Solution": "Looking for specific mention of minerals that supply these major elements to the ocean and how they are delivered. Also, what do they have in common? These are all conservative ions, so they have high concentrations in the world\u2019s ocean today and their concentrations scale with salinity.Weathering and delivery via rivers are the primary source, although additional possible sources such as hydrothermal vents and submarine groundwater discharge should be considered. Apatite, Na- plagioclase-feldspar, and oxidative weathering of pyrite are the main minerals that should be discussed as sources of these conservative ions. NaCl (halite) may be mentioned, but it\u2019s not a true source since it is the recycling of chloride and sodium from evaporites back to seawater. These elements had to originally get into seawater via another pathway. "
