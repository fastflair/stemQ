       "Original question": "Discuss some processes through which global warming can influence the concentration of oxygen in the water column?",
       "Solution": "Marine oxygen concentrations are affected by a combination of physical and biological processes, specifically solubility, air-sea gas exchange, photosynthesis, and remineralization. Warming will decrease oxygen solubility, so the equilibrated surface ocean will hold less oxygen. This is particularly important at higher latitudes, which reportedly will experience the greatest degree of warming, because bottom waters sourced from high latitudes will start off with less oxygen (assuming similar ocean turnover rates). Ocean anoxia and expanded oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are predicted for the future ocean owing to warming and are thought to have characterized past oceans in greenhouse conditions."
