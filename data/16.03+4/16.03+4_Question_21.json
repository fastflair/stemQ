       "Original question": "Consider the signal g(t) = (1 + |t|)e\u2212|t|. How close is the answer to the theoretical lower bound? Explain why the answer is or is not close to the bound.",
       "Solution": "The duration\u00ad bandwidth product is \u0394t\u0394\u03c9 = 4 \u221a7/5 which is very close to the theoretical lower limit of 2. This is not surprising, since the shape of g(t) is close to a gaussian."
