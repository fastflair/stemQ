Find the impulse response corresponding to the transfer function G(s),\nusing partial fraction expansion and inverse Laplace techniques. Hint: The poles of the system are complex, so you will have to do complex arithmetic.",
       "Solution": "From the problem statement,\n\u221a   9.82 m/s2\n\u03c9n = 2 129 m/s = 0.1077 r/s\n \u03b6 = \u221a 1 2(L0/D0\n= \u221a 1 = 0.0471 2 \u00b7 15\n    Therefore,\nG \u0304 ( s ) =\nThe roots of the denominator are at s = 0, and\n1\ns (s2 + 0.01015s + 0.0116)\n s = \u22120.01915 \u00b1\n= \u22120.005075 \u00b1 0.1075j\n\u221a\n0.010152 \u2212 4 \u00b7 0.0116 2\n  So\nG \u0304 ( s ) = 1\ns (s \u2212 [\u22120.005075 + 0.1075j]) (s \u2212 [\u22120.005075 \u2212 0.1075j])\n Use the coverup method to obtain the partial fraction expansion\n86.283 \u221243.142 + 2.036j G(s) = s + s \u2212 [\u22120.005075 + 0.1075j]\n+ \u221243.142 \u2212 2.036j\ns \u2212 [\u22120.005075 \u2212 0.1075j]\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform (assuming that g \u0304(t) is causal), we have g \u0304(t) =86.283\u03c3(t)\n+ (\u221243.142 + 2.036j)e(\u22120.005075+0.1075j)t + (\u221243.142 \u2212 2.036j)e(\u22120.005075\u22120.1075j)t\nTherefore,\ng \u0304(t) = \u03c3(t) [86.283 + 2e\u22120.005075t (\u221243.142 cos \u03c9dt \u2212 2.036 sin \u03c9dt)]\n= \u03c3(t) [86.283 + (\u221286.284 cos \u03c9dt \u2212 4.072 sin \u03c9dt) e\u22120.005075t] where \u03c9d = 0.1075 r/s.
