       "Original question": "If we have a state machine , defined as s_t = f(s_(t-1), x_t) and y_t = g(s_t) , where x_t is the input , what is the output y_5 if we have s_0 being 11 , f(s_(t-1), x_t) = max ( s_(t-1) , x_t ) , g(s_t) = 2 * s_t , and we input [ 4 12 5 3 16 ] ?",
       "Solution": 32.0
