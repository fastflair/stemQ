       "Original question": "Determine whether the following statements are True or False. Explain your answer. A government sets a price ceiling for widgets that is below the equilibrium price. This intervention will always decrease the producer surplus, increase consumer surplus and decrease total surplus.",
       "Solution": "False, it might increase or decrease consumer surplus. Price decreases but also quantity decreases. The firm(s) might also exit the market if the price is below average cost which would result in zero consumer surplus."
