       "Original question": "Suppose that there are only two products, computers and automobiles. Automobiles are more labor-intensive (requires relatively more labor) and are produced according to the production function F_A(K, L) = K^(1/3)*L^(2/3) . Computers are more capital intensive (require relatively more capital) and are produced according to the function F_C(K, L) = K^(2/3)*L^(1/3) Suppose that both labor and capital are perfectly mobile across the two industries. That is, workers and capital can switch fluidly from producing computers to producing cars and vice versa. For this problem, assume everything is in perfect competition.\n  \nSuppose that the United States has 30 units of labor total and 240 units of capital, and all labor and capital is utilized for production. The price of automobiles is pA = 200 while the price of computers are pc = 100 under autarky. How much labor and capital is used for the production of automobiles under autarky? How much labor and capital is used to produce computers under autarky?\n\n(Hint: Use the condition on wages and prices of capital you found in the previous exercise. In perfectly competitive labor and capital markets, what is the relationship between wages (or price of capital), the production function, and the price of the output goods?)",
       "Solution": "Capital input for automobiles = 80\nLabor input for automobiles = 20\nCapital input for computers = 160\nLabor input for computers = 10\n\nMPL_A is the derivative of a production function for automobiles with respect to labor.\nK_A is capital input for automobiles.\n\n200*MPL_A = 100*MPL_C\n(400/3)*(K_A/L_A)^(1/3) = (100/3)*((240-K_A)/(30-L_A))^(2/3)\n\n200*MPK_A = 100*MPK_C\n(200/3)*(K_A/L_A)^(-2/3) = (200/3)*((240-K_A)/(30-L_A))^(-1/3)\n\nSubstitute and solve for \nK_A, L_A, K_C, L_C\n\n\n"
