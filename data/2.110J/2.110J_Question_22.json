       "Original question": "X-rays from a copper x-ray tube (\u03bb = 1.54062 \u00c5 or 154.062 pm) are diffracted at an angle of 10.89\u00b0 from a sample of crystalline gold. Assuming that n = 1, what is the distance between the planes that gives rise to this reflection? Give your answer in angstroms and picometers to four significant figures.",
