       "Original question": "A bag contains one marble which is either green or blue, with equal probabilities. A green marble is put in the bag (so there are 2 marbles now), and then a random marble is taken out. The marble taken out is green. What is the probability that the remaining marble is also green?",
       "Solution": "2/3"
