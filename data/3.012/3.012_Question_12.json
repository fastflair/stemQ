       "Original question": "A mass of 32.0 g of H2O(g) at 373 K is flowed into 295 g of H2O(l) at 310. K and 1 atm. Calculate the final temperature of the system once equilibrium has been reached.\nAssume that C_{P, m} for H2O is constant at its values for 298 K throughout the temperature range of interest. ",
       "Solution": "369 K"
