       "Original question": "The price of a turkey is proportional to its weight and inversely proportional to the square of its age. Jack\u2019s mother gives him enough money to buy a 10 pound turkey that is one year old. When Jack gets to the fair, he realizes that he needs a turkey that is slightly bigger. How much older will the turkey have to be per extra pound in weight?\nPlease begin by writing down an equation satisfied by price, weight and age, giving the interpretation and units for all varialbles and constants used.",
       "Solution": "The wording of the problem may be translated into the equation p=kw/a^2\nwhere w is the weight (the problem suggests units of pounds), a is its age (units of years), and p is the price of the turkey (units of in dollars or your favorite medieval currency). The proportionality constant k then has units of dollars times years squared per pound.\nThe problem calls for us to evaluate da/dw along the level curve where p is constant, throught the point (w, a) = (10, 1). We use the formula da = \u2212 pw . The partial deriva-\n   tives of p(w, a) are given by\nTherefore,\ndw pa\n\u2202p(w,a) = k \u2202w a2\n\u2202p(w,a) = \u22122kw. \u2202a a3\nda pw k/a2 a dw=\u2212p =2kw/a3=2w.\n        a\nEvaluating at the point (10, 1) gives 1/20. Thus, for each pound more tha Jack needs, he must be willing to accept a turkey 1/20 year older and tougher.\n[Note that the units are in years per pound, which is consistent with computation we are trying to compute how mthat it represents how many more years the turkey will have per ound of extra weight.]"
