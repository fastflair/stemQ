       "Original question": "a) Determine the horizontal and vertical forces acting on a wall sloped at angle, \u03b8, to the horizontal seafloor as\na function of z. Assume that the water is h deep and that atmospheric pressure acts everywhere.\nb) Determine the total resulting force and center of pressure. ",
       "Solution": "a) vertical force = -pgwH^2cot(\u03b8)/2, horizontal force =pgwH^2/2\n\nb) pgwsin(\u03b8)L^2/2, L/3"
