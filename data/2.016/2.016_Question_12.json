       "Original question": "When we in the United States say a car\u2019s tire is filled \u201cto\n32 lb,\u201d we mean that its internal pressure is 32 lbf/in2\nabove the ambient atmosphere. If the tire is at sea level,\nhas a volume of 3.0 ft^3 and is at 75\u0006F, estimate the total\nweight of air, in lbf, inside the tire.",
       "Solution": "0.71 lbf"
