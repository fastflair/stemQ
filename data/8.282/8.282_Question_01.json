       "Original question": "Derive  the ratio between the stellar mass density $\\rho_{*}$ and the current critical density. Assume that the density of galaxies is 2 $\\times$ 10$^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, that in each galaxy there are 5 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ stars, and that each star has an average mass of 0.5 M$_{\\sun}$. Assume that the current critical density, $\\rho_{c,0}$, is 1.4 \\times 10^{11} \\frac{M_{\\Sun}}{Mpc^3}.",
       "Solution": "3.6 \\times 10^{-3}"
