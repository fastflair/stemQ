       "Original question": "Imagine that the world has 24 time zones (evenly spaced around the globe) and that a class has exactly one student in each time zone. How many ways are there to form 12 partnerships (2 students each) if you insist that each student\u2019s partner live in a timezone where the time differs by at most 2 hours (ignoring date)?",
