       "Original question": "A muon has lifetime of 2*10^\u22126 s in its rest frame. It is created 100 km above the earth and moves towards it at a speed 2.97 * 108m/s. At what altitude does it decay? According to the muon, how far did it travel in its brief life?",
       "Solution": "The muon decays at 95.8 km above the ground. According to the muon, it has traveled 590 m."
