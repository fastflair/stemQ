       "Original question": "A block of mass M sits on frictionless table L meters from the edge. At t = 0 bullet of mass m and velocity v1 penetrates it from left and exits to the right with a speed v2.  If the table has a height h how far from the edge of the table will it land?  (Neglect loss of wood in block due to bullet penetrating it and the time it takes bullet to traverse block.)",
       "Solution": "x = (v1-v2) * m/M * sqrt(2*h/g)"
