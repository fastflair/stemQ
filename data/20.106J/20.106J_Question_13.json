       "Original question": "How is rotational energy in the ATPase used to produce ATP?",
       "Solution": "Rotational energy in ATPase is used to produce ATP via proton motive forse coupled to conformational changes in subunits of ATPase holoenzyme. Movement of protons through the Fo subunit drives rotation of the c proteins generating torque. Conformational changes in the \u03b2-subuint transfers this potential energy to the F1 subunit."
