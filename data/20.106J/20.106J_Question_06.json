       "Original question": "What are the gram negative and gram positive bacterial major differences, and their biological implications",
       "Solution": "Gram-positive: no outer-membrane thus cell wall consists of only wall-anchored proteins, teichoic acids & lipoteichoic acid in the peptidoglycan layer.\\nGram-negative: outer-membrane + peptidogylcan layer (periplasm); the outer-membrane consists of lipopolysaccharide, porins, lipoproteins, and phospholipids.\\n Biological implications: (reasonable answers accepted) The outer-membrane of gram-negative organisms allows space for many enzymes to reside outside the cell membrane such as chemo receptors and transporters, as well as porins on through the outer-membrane. At the same time, endotoxins due to lipid A of LPS are present in gram-negative organisms.\\n"
