       "Original question": "Describe a direct and an indirect method to measure microbial growth.",
       "Solution": "Direct counts can be accomplished using a light microscope. Medium containing the cells is placed in a counting chamber, which is a microscope slide containing etched lines forming a grid of known size. Because the cover slip is a known distance above the slide, each grid contains a known voume of medium. By counting the cells in several grids, the number of cells in the culture can be calculated.\\n Indirect counts are based on turbidity of the medium (culture). The culture is placed in a spectrophotometer cell and the absorbance is measured. Under limited conditions (log growth), the number of cells present can be estimated fairly accurately using a standard curve generated by plate counts at the time of absorbance readings."
