       "Original question": "Explain the circumstances under which the same substance can be either an electron donor or an electron acceptor.",
       "Solution": "The coupler pairing determines acceptor versus donor. The substance with a more positive E \u2019 is the o e- donor and the more negative E \u2019 is the e- acceptor. Thus, depending on the available copule for reduction or oxidation, and the relative concentrations of each species (both e- donor and acceptor) a substance will act as an e- acceptor or donor."
