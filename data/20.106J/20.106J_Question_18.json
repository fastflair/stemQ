       "Original question": "Explain our current understanding of molecular adaptations to the cytoplasmic membrane that are present in psychrophiles and describe their habitat. How about thermophiles?",
       "Solution": "Typically psychrophiles are found where the temperature is constantly cold opposed to seasonal winters. Their cytoplasmic membranes contain higher concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids and sometimes polyunsaturated fatty acids that maintain a semifluid state at low temperatures. Enzymes of psychrophiles are cold-active with greater amounts of \u03b1-helices and fewer \u03b2-sheets as well as greater numbers of polar amino acids. Thermophiles would be found in environments that are consistently hot. Therefore, thermophiles have enzymes and other proteins that are more stable and function optimally at high temperatures. Cytoplasmic membranes of thermophiles also contain lipids rich in saturated fatty acids, which allow form stronger hydrophobic environments (more stable membrane in heat)."
