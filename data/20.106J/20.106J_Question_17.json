       "Original question": "Discuss why energy yield in an organism undergoing anaerobic respiration is less than that of an organism undergoing aerobic respiration.",
       "Solution": "Answers will vary. Basically, O has a more positive E \u2019, therefore in coupled redox reactions more 2o free energy is available using O2 as the terminal electron acceptor."
