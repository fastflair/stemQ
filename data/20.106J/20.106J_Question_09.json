       "Topic": "Systems Microbiology",
       "Original question": "Describe the three different functional types of transport systems, and their general similarities and differences.a",
       "Solution": "Simple transporters: involve only a membrane-spanning component (ie Lac permease transporter) \\nPhosphotransferase-type transporters: involve series of proteins that cooperate in the transport event (ie phosphotransferase system)\\nABC systems: involve a membrane-spanning component, a periplasmic-binding component and ATP- hydrolyzing proteins (kinases)."
