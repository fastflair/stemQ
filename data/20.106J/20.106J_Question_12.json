       "Original question": "What does proton motive force mean, and why is it important in biology?",
       "Solution": "The porton motive force is an \u201cenergized\u201d state of a membrane created by the expulsion of protons to the exterior face of the membrane creating a \u201ccharge separation\u201d similar to a battery. The dissipation of this charge gradient through a membrane-bound ATPase complex provides energy for ATP synthesis."
