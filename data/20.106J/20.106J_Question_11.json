       "Original question": "If you were to follow the synthesis of flagella with a \u201cpulse chase\u201d experiment, by adding first unlabelled amino acids followed by radio-labeled amino acids, what pattern of labeling during flagellar biosynthesis would you expect to see?",
       "Solution": "A, flagellin monomers added to tip, not base."
