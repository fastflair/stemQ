       "Original question": "For methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP) that respond to chemoattractants, the \u201cground state\u201d is high sensitivity, with decreaseing sensitivity as the organism traverses the gradient, and eventual re-set by demethylation (presumabley when the desirable chemoattractant is depleted). Do you think an MCP involved exclusively in responding to noxious stimuli that an organism tries to avoid would work the same or differently? Explain your reasoning.",
       "Solution": "MCPs responding to repellents work the opposite of those responding to attractants with regards to sensitivity and running with changes in stimulant (can be attractant or repellant) concentration. The proteins within the chemotaxis pathway all work the same. Repellent MCPs have highly methylated, insensitive \u2018ground states\u2019. Upon activation, they activate CheA, which is the opposite of attractant MCPs. This situation is similar to the \u2018no stimulant/no prey\u2019 situation discussed in class. CheA is phosphorylated leading to phosphorylation of CheY and CheB. The presence of phosphorylated CheY causes tumbling more often. Phosphorylated CheB de-methylates the MCP, increasing sensitivity to repellent (less repellent required for activation). In turn, if the concentration of repellent decreases, the receptor is less \u2018active\u2019 causing less CheY phosphorylation leading to longer runs. This would coincide with less phosphorylated CheB, more CheR, and re-setting of the sensitivity to the \u2018ground state\u2019 of high methylation. The mechanisms of the pathways are the same, with the exception of the initial activation of the receptor. Upon stimulation with repellent, CheW inhibits CheA causing less phosphorylation and more methylation, whereas a repellent activates CheA causing more phosphorylation and de-methylation (less methylation)."
