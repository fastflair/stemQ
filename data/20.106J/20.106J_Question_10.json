       "Original question": "Draw and describe the structural and functional components and properties of bacterial flagella, and their general mode of synthesis.",
       "Solution": "Flagella are long, spiral-shaped rods anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane, and are attached to the cell surface by a complex of flagellar motor proteins, which include L & P rings anchoring the hook to the outer membrane and peptidoglycan, Mot proteins,MS and C rings that surround the Fli proteins (motor switch) located in the cytoplasminc membrane There is a hook in the flagellum filament that adjoins the flagellum and flagellar motor. Flagellum is a multimer of the protein flagellin. Synthesis begins with the motor proteins, then the hook ending with flagellin monomers to grow the flagellum."
